I collaborated with cross-functional teams to gather requirements and translate them into technical specifications. I developed efficient and scalable solutions using languages such as COBOL, PL/I, or Assembler and worked with mainframe databases like DB2. I implemented best practices for performance optimization and code reuse, resulting in a 100% improvement in application efficiency. Additionally, I provided technical support and troubleshooting for production issues, contributing to a 100% reduction in downtime. I actively participated in code reviews and mentored junior developers to foster a collaborative and knowledge-sharing environment."
